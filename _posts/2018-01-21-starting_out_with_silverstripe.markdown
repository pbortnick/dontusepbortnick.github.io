I was introduced to SilverStripe last week which is an interactive CMS that uses flexible MVC frameworks. The site includes in depth tutorials on how to use the service. Amidst following along, I recognized the similarities between it and Angular as well as Ruby on Rails, which made it easier to learn. It seems like a great framework so far and I am looking forward to continued practice. If you want to learn it, I would suggest following along with their tutorials at https://www.silverstripe.org/learn/lessons/v4/ as well as playing around with your own projects. I am starting to work with forms and multiple templates now. It puts emphasis on using DRY practices which I, of course, support and wish to get better at. It is a great service for consultants and freelancers to use when creating client sites.
