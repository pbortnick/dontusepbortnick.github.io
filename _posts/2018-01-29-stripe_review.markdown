I completed (well are you ever really complete with code?) an assignment in which I had to integrate Stripe subscription functionality with a standard Rails MVC setup. Stripe is a service for developers to integrate into their site for easier management of customers, subscriptions, orders, payments, and more. It is growing in popularity withing the e-commerce world for several reasons: 

**For Merchants:**
1. Stripe directly connects to the credit card companies related to users' payments
2. This provides automatic transfers the charge to the merchant's account
3. Will not interfere with the aesthetics of site

**For Developers:**
1. Easy to use with development background
2. Offers extremely detailed API documentation
3. Uses REST
3. It can be used with several different languages including: 
* Python
* Ruby
* PHP
* Java
* Node.js
* Go

Stripe is becoming a strong contender for PayPal. However if you own an e-commerce site, it is definitely important to research more about each option.
