Thanks to my Flatiron education, I was lucky enough to get a first round interview with a tech company in NYC. It is customary for coders to be assigned a challenge after the first or second round interview. As much as your personality and professional skills help you get a job, technical skills are still very valued. Here are some steps I took and some I wish I took to tackle my first code challenge.

**1. Plan it out**

I like to use physical paper for this but some like to use a note editor.  Much like we learned while studying math or for the SATs, first write out the requirements given. Then write out a general plan on how to tackle the problem. Then decide what language(s) you can use to execute it.

**2. Ask questions**

This is a difficult step. Some people may be ashamed of the questions they have, thinking "this is probably obvious" or "I should know this already". I am definitely guilty of this type of thinking. But it really does look good to ask any sort of question you may have. I mean, don't ask for the solution. But there is no shame in needing help to get you there. The challenge may need some clarification. Or you may need a suggestion on a common way to get started. Or what language is preffered/reccommended.

**3. Reach out for help**

Hopefully you have some connections within your school or your outside network that have experience coding.  You may be stuck on a bug for hours, and given that there is normally a due date, you need to be efficient with your time. Or you may just need a push to get it going. When deciding whether or not to ask, it helps to put yourself in the other person's shoes. If someone asked you for assistance, I'm sure you'd be more than happy to discuss.

**4. Do research**

Researching similar types of problems or strategies is not cheating. Google searches are essential for coding, not memorization. But if you do happen to find a solution to the specific challenge, AVOID IT, because it will be hard not to copy, and that IS cheating.

**5. Write comments**

Comments help to walk an observer through your work. Even though we may be proficient in Javascript or Ruby, English is our first language. Explain yourself with brief comments throughout your code.

**6. Proofread**

Read over your work and see if there is any way you can make your code more concise and neat.

**7. Write a ReadMe **

A readme is a great way to fully explain your work and how to utilize it. Include instructions on how to run your code. Also include your thought process and strategy. You may want to write out what you could have done differently and how you would have tackled this in an actual work setting.
