Well last week was a long one. I saw 4 concerts, worked 3 valet shifts, attended 2 holiday parties, hosted 1, and still managed to find time to practice coding. I really don't know how I did it, but I learned the basics of Angular last week.

I  was a little nervous heading into the holidays because I used to have trouble with time management and I didn't want to fall back into old habits. Luckily, I've learned to take advantage of calendars, lists, and schedules but these tricks can fall through the cracks when too many fun and exciting things are happening. But I know the key to being a proficient engineer is continued practice and I didn't want to lose a week of that. 

I'm proud that I successfully took advantage of the breaks in my busy schedule by waking up early and getting a head start on each day. I spent my mornings and some afternoons working on my website project or going through Angular lessons and labs (depending on what I prepared for that day).

Keeping your work up can be tough even if there is no outside chaos . So it is essential to recognize the extra push you'll need.
