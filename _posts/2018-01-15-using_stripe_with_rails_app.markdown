I recently was given a challenge that required integrating Stripe with a Rails app. Stripe is a gem that easily manages subscriptions and payments for your site. It can be quite difficult when using detailed gems for the first time within an application. It reminds me of when I was first introduced to Devise. I accidentally skipped one little step and nothing was working - typical coder problem, I know. It is helpful to recall similar experiences in order to evaluate your approach to a new problem. For example, what usually helps me the most is watching tutorial videos and reviewing example repos. So that is how I tackled this new experience of using Stride with a mock website.

Turns out it is really cool. Very user-friendly and adaptable. I wouldn't say I am an expert and could give my own tutorials yet. I just started getting it to work. But that is the goal. Check back in to see if I get there.
