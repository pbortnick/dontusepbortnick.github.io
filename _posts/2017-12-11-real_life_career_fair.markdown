Regardless of what field you're in, all the career blogs and experts will tell you to network and to attend meetups and fairs. So I did. I saw that there was a tech talent career fair coming up in NYC and decided to apply. I had attended a few in college but they were always geared towards the School of Management folks, leaving us lowly engineers in the dust. I was super pumped to see that there was an event specifically for my field. Take that accounting and business students! 

(Kidding, you're great. But I still hold a grudge against Binghamton SOM. Its fine, I'm fine, I'll be fine....)

OK. Overall, the career fair went well. I talked to some people, handed out some resumes, and got some business cards. I think that is pretty successful considering the fact that NYC career fairs are more crowded than a bar in midtown on a Saturday night. Didn't think that was possible? Me neither.

Some tips that helped me:
* Research the companies that are listed as attending and create a cheat sheet. Print this sheet and have it handy. Review it briefly before approaching a table. Include:
1. Company name
2. Overall mission
3. Jobs they have listed
4. How you fit the role(s)
5. Bonus - if you know who the person/people representing the company will be - do a little research on them and jot down some notes. Don't be afraid to online stalk! Seriously, everyone does it these days and it is flattering, rather than creepy. 

* Dress professionally casual

* Bring resumes, business cards, a notebook, a pen, and a folder to hold business cards, info sheets, and/or pamphlets. (I suggest getting a padfolio - so profesh)

* Optional - Bring a small backpack for your supplies. This also comes in handy for storing all the swag you're going to get.

* Be yourself - Pam, be cheesier. But seriously. Just chill and go for it. 

Heres a story about how being myself helped me overcome a fairly embarrassing situation I got myself into at the event:

So at the career fair, I noticed that each table was designated to one company and had two or three people standing behind it as representatives. Well, all except for one. I recognized the company that I was most excited to talk to on the other side of the room. I made my way over and mentally reviewed the speech I had prepared. There were two people behind the table. I go over to one man, pumped up, and he asked why I was so interested in the company so I gave him my shpiel. He stops me a sentence or two in and says "uhhh I think you're talking about her company" and points to the woman standing right next to him. Turns out this table was designated to TWO companies and I got so excited that I completely ignored the sign sitting right in front of him. I was obviously so embarrased. My heart sunk and I immediately began shaming myself. But then, I took a breath. Instead of allowing myself to be overwhelmed by anxiety, I apologized, laughed it off, and told him I'd still love to hear about his company. Unfortunately, I don't he was entertained, as he refused to shake my hand and quickly shooed me away. No big deal. Mistakes happen. Anyways, I eventually make it to the woman who he had pointed to and told her what had just happened. She loved my enthusiasm for her company and thankfully found the story funny and cute. So I added my name to her recruitment list and am hoping to hear back soon!
