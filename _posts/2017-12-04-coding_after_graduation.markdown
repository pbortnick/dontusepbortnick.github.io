After my Flatiron School graduation, I took a few days to bask in the amazing feeling that comes with such an accomplishment. I reflected on my experience and allowed myself to feel a sense of pride. But it was time to get back to business. I know the best way to get better at programming, or anything, is practice. So I decided to begin working on a little idea I had to create a website for both beginner and experienced coders to share every-day tips they have found useful. I thought of this after learning some life changing shortcuts or debugging practices that I never knew existed.

I am still in the beginning stages but I have decided to focus on employing Rails and Javascript. These are languages I feel confident in and have really enjoyed using throughout my bootcamp. However, even with such confidence, I can always improve. So I am excited to see what challenges are presented and the process I take to overcome them. So far in my studies I have learned that when seriously struggling to fix an issue, it is best to walk away, take a breath, refresh your brain and come back to the problem. After that, something that seemed nearly impossible can usually be solved in a few minutes. I am also looking forward to playing around with CSS after the Rails/Javascript code is complete. I love being able to access my artistic inclinations through technology and I can't wait to make this site look as beautiful as possible, which definitely enhances the user experience. 

Working on a project without any outside direction is both terrifying and exciting. Even though there are helpful sites and people out there, it is mainly on you to get this done. There is no due date or grade so it is easy to get distracted from your project. But it is always important to stay focused and maintain your drive. You will be happier in the long run and will be able to share your work with the world! And hopefully at least one person finds it useful.
