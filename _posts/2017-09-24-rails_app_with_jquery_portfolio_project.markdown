This app builds upon my Travel Agency Rails app by implementing jQuery functions. It improves the original app by decreasing the need for page refreshes in order to receive information.

You can view the repository here:

For example, you may view details about a certain destination directly from the homepage by clicking on the "More Info" button, rather than navigating to the chosen destination's show page.

You can also view all destinations a travel agent handles directly from the travel agent's page by clicking "Load Destinations".

You can navigate from agent to agent by using the "Next Agent" link.


Finally, you can add a new destination from the agent's page.!
