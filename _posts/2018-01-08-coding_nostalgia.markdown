My passion for coding started while learning Python in a course during my undergraduate studies. My fellow students and I were kind of thrown into it without being taught the basics or anything. It is the first time I experienced imposter syndrome. My high school did not provide any computer classes, minus the occasional Microsoft Office lessons, and it seemed like everyone else in my major knew exactly what they were doing. I, meanwhile, didn't know the first thing about computer programming. I instantly decided I would not be able to do it and gave up. But once I released the fear of what people would think of me or that I would fail, I became quite good. I ended up staying up late at night working on a project because I became so obsessed with learning and coding and refactoring. It was unreal. I never knew I could create something that actually worked! I ended up building a Python-based command line interface program that allowed users to choose the healthiest city to live in based on their preferences and the data initially provided.

Although my Flatiron education was extremely comprehensive, it did not cover Python for the most part. So lately I've become nostalgic and have been taking my spare time to re-learn it. I remember most of the basics but now I am really diving in to some of the more nitty gritty aspects. I just need to dig up that old project and refactor it even more!
