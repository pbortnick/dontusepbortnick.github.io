I can't believe I am writing about my final project. My time as a student at Flatiron has taught me so much and I am beyond excited to apply my new skills to my professional development.

For my final project, I combined ideas from previous projects and created a site that displays concert details and venue details. Users are also allowed to add a new concert to the database. Since this is the final project, I employed some CSS styling techniques which was a lot of fun. I added React and Redux processest to my Rails app.

It was quite difficult getting started. But throughout the entire process, I kept my mind focused and did not let myself get overwhelmed.

Here are some snippets from the site I built:
