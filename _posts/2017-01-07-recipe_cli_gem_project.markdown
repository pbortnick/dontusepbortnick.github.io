Throughout this Ruby assignment, I challenged myself and learned a lot. I chose to create a gem that scrapes the recipe of the day from *mydailymoment.com* and *foodnetwork.com*. My Recipe gem provides users with information on a daily recipe from each site including total time, servings, ingredients, and instructions.

Here are some snapshots of my code:
