Imagine a coffee machine...

**Model** - Holds all logic

The machine. It knows what to do depending on which button is pressed. It knows it has to heat up the water and grind the beans.


**Controller** - Interacts with data from model to pass along to view

The specifc type/amount of coffee. Once a button is hit, the controller will interact with the model and find out what will need to be outputted.


**View** - Contains as little logic as possible. Renders viewable page.

The mug. The mug just has to sit there and look pretty (especially if you have a cool mug collection like I do) and wait for the coffee to be rendered into it.
