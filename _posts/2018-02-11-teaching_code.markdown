The past few weeks I have taken on a new responsibility as a coder. I was hired as a Techincal Coach at the Flatiron School to help current students get un-stuck on labs and give them a better understanding of development concepts. It is interesting as a recent web devepment graduate to be sharing my knowledge and experience with prospective engineers. The experience has been extremely gratifying in a variety of ways. 

When a new concept a student has been struggling to understand or an error he or she has been taking forever to solve suddenly becomes clear, it is almost as good a feeling as when I experience that myself. In order to get there, I try to display debugging techniques and problem solving skills so that they can carry that on with them when they experience the same issue again. Learning to code is extremely challenging and it is important to have a support group there to push you along.

Coaching has also enhanced my ability to communicate code in general. Figuring out different ways to explain analytical concepts in regular English has always been challenging to me. But daily communication with students and fellow grads has allowed me to practice this type of communication. And as with everything, practice makes perfect.

In general, I have always hear that teaching is the best way to learn and I completely support that notion. I have always felt that way but teaching code has provided me with complete validation.
