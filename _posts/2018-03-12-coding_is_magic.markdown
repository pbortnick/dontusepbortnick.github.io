I recently had a conversation with a Flatiron student who's app wasn't working due to a minor syntax error. Something like missing the word "create" in an ActiveRecord migration. He stated "this stuff is magic but also so syntactically specific." In which I responed with "magic is syntactically specific!"

Which seriously made me think. I've read all the Harry Potter series multiple times and I get super excited whenever the marathon is being ran on TV. Little did I know, the Flatiron School was basically Hogwarts. I mean, without all the dementors and talking paintings. But coding IS like magic. Much like creating spells, we write functions that if not put in a specific order, won't produce the right result and we might end up vommiting frogs for the rest of the day, who knows?
