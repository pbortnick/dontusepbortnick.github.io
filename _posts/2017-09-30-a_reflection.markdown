As I begin to wrap up my coursework at the Flatiron School and begin my career as a professional web devloper, I find myself reflecting on the experience as a whole. Almost every person I meet or run into asks the question "So, what do you do?". Although I was working full time at the beginning of my studies, I was always so proud to respond with the simple "I am studying web development". Yes, people are impressed, but that doesn't matter to me. I am impressed with myself. Web development is hard work. Once you think you got something down, there is a new challenge that awaits. It opens up doors that I never knew existed. It helps you share stories with people about your experiences as well as theirs. It helps you connect to people with similar passions. I have never been the best writer (one of the reasons I went into engineering during undergrad --- numbers are great) so I never knew I could actually be a professional writer - writing code.
