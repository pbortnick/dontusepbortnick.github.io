During my most recent project review, I was put to the challenge of refactoring my code. As you may have experienced, often when refactoring, everything starts to break. It is hard to keep track of what changes you have made and where you made them. It feels like you are playing hide and seek with your working code.

Well this happened to me. And I recognized feelings of anxiety and pressure well on their way. But instead of letting the stress and confusion beat me down, I overcame it before it hit (well, hard at least). I kept my cool by staying focused, keeping track of my code with detailed notes, and taking breaks when necessary.

I am thankful for the skills I have developed, both in life and as a Flatiron student, for overcoming difficult situations. Since I employed these skills, I was able to efficiently complete my project and pass my final review.
